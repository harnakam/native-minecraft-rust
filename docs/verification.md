# Verification

## Commands

```sh
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo build -p rmc-client --locked
python scripts/audit_publication.py
cargo run -p rmc-client -- verify live-suite --mcp-root MCP-919
```

The live suite requires a local MCP919 installation and Java. It instruments the local reference client and captures both clients against a scripted server. Reference sources, reports and captures remain ignored.

## Observed results (2026-09-30, Windows)

The official 1.8.9 server JAR was checked against its published object SHA1, then run locally after the user confirmed EULA acceptance. Offline compressed login, join, chunk reception, windowed rendering and a ten-second forward/sprint run succeeded. The window smoke received 49 chunks and advanced 118 ticks. The movement run advanced 200 ticks and received 77 chunks without a server disconnect.

The strict live comparison passes: packet 54 Rust / 54 Java records; movement 35 / 35; combat 3 / 3; inventory 5 / 5, with zero differences. The movement capture includes the initial correction and 34 local ticks. Initial-position readiness, script timing and swing-before-attack ordering were corrected. Packet records retain their order within each TCP direction; scheduling order between independent directions is normalized. These counts describe scripted coverage, not overall parity.

Old comparison logic discarded most records and vertical coordinates. It has been removed. All records and six movement coordinates are retained, empty traces fail, and old comparison reports cannot open the compatibility gate. The current scripted reports open that gate; this only permits further testing and does not certify Hypixel gameplay, which remains unverified.

## Local collision and travel probes

```sh
python scripts/verify_local_oracles.py --mcp-root MCP-919 --java-home /path/to/jdk8
```

The command compiles only the authored `RmcCollisionOracle` and `RmcMovementOracle` helpers against an already compiled local MCP installation. Java classes, assets and reports remain local and ignored. Rust dependencies must be cached for its offline Cargo calls. Supply `--cargo /path/to/cargo` when needed.

Observed: 3,039 valid block/metadata collision cases match by complete union of AABB volumes. Invalid Java metadata states are excluded; this probe places one block without neighbors and does not verify connected geometry or moving piston tile entities. The twelve travel cases (walk, diagonal, sprint, held jump, ice, soul sand, slime, water, lava, ladder, web and slab stepping) match 960 ticks in position, velocity and ground state at tolerance 2e-7. The travel probe invokes the actual Java player/living movement methods with directly controlled inputs; it does not cover every client input transition, enchantment, entity interaction or fluid flow configuration.

## Limits

Unit tests do not establish complete Minecraft compatibility. Additional fixtures must cover liquids, ladders, effects, complex block geometry, specialized inventory slots, respawn/dimension changes and real online multiplayer sessions. Authentication secrets must never appear in captures or commits.
